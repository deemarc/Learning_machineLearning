# Learning_machineLearning
a collection of python programming I write when I learn about machine learning

I will be following the tutorial on https://pythonprogramming.net, and I think it's a good Idea to keep the record on code I have tried :)

great website to get some dataset to use with machine learning algorithm you've written:
[UCI's Machine Learning Repository](http://localhost:8888/?token=78aaab18cd67f5aa1ea35e22697b670816f80033f41b5982)

I just found this [Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months) and I think it is a good instuction to follow :)
